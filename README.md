# Overview

The experience and flow of the application resemble that of a typical e-commerce application, including:

- The shopping cart page shows a total cost for all products in the cart
- Input forms are validated (e.g., a minimum length for the customer’s name on the shopping cart checkout page)
- The details page for a product shows a photo of the product, the name, the price, and the description.
- Products can be removed from the cart
- An order confirmation page (e.g. a “success” page) is shown to the user after successful checkout
